# Analysis on bike sharing data with SQL and Tableu

Analysis on the Cyclistic bike-share case study (Google Capstone Project 1)

## Introduction
In this case study we work for a fictional company, Cyclistic, and we are asked to follow the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.

## Business Task
Cyclisticâ€™s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.   
Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.
How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently? 

## 1. Ask
The business task is maximize the number of annual memberships and the idea is to do that by converting casual riders into annual riders.
In order to do so the question we are trying to answer is, specifically, how casual riders differ from annual members.

## 2. Prepare
I'm using all the data for the 12 months of year 2020 ( from 01/01 until 31/12). Data is stored in CSV file available [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).
The data is public and made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [this license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).
The privacy of the riders is safeguard as there are no IDs and it's not possible to identify the riders.

## 3. Process
I will use SQL Server to (which makes importing csv and excel files easy) clean the data and make them ready for analysis. 
Data consists of different csv files. They contain 13 columns related to bike trips such as starting and ending stations, memebrship status, etc.
Before importing files into SQL Server, I made sure that data are generally consistent. There however some inconsistencies:

- departure and arrival times data with negative values
- several values that pertain to test 
- several blanks (which start to appear from march, so the company might want to inquire why)

I will address all of these issues in the cleaning process. Time to start now.
For this process I have decided to use SQL Server, as it makes working with excel files easier (the full SQL script is available [here](https://github.com/Eudossodicnido/Analysis-on-bike-sharing-data/commit/487ba7db71d96a380ffa844206036134e497a8f8)).

The first step is putting all the data into a single table.

</p>

</p>

Now that we have a single table, it's time to make it fit for analysis. 
I'll first eliminate the null values.

</p>

Then I'll calculate the length of the rides and the day of week.

</p>

Finally, I'll remove the test and inconsistent ride lengths values.

## 4. Analyze + 5. Share
### Overview

I will perform the stages togheter, as I will visualise and share the findings as I go through.
I will perform my analysis by comparing the two groups, since understanding their differences is the goal. Anyway, i will exclude the rides longer than 24 hours, as there is a minority that hugely skew the data.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69009356/153856001-3f7f1723-917a-4c27-9914-39863c09078e.png" />
</p>

</p>

We can immediatly see that about 2/3 of the rides are from members but the account for about 1/3. 
But let's have a broader look.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69009356/153876206-0abea156-5eb6-423e-a11a-7144b35d14b4.png" />
</p>

We get an immediate confirmation of the chart above.
We can see that the two groups share a similar pattern (especially from April to December). The main difference regards the winter.
Memebers are somehow consistent during this season, even though on a descending line (with the peak in April which might be related to COVID, given the fact the data is from 2020), while members are particularly inactive. 
It is intersting to note that from that from April to August (the peak) the volume of rides increase about 5 times for members while it increases about 12 times for members. 


<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69009356/153901145-0b34f84e-f0fa-406e-85d5-f7e1c5988420.png" />
</p>

Regarding the average ride lenghts we can also see that members are quite consistent while casual riders tend to have more variation. 
As hinted by the previous chart we know can see that, averagely, members tend to do use bikes more often and for short rides compared to casual riders that do less rides but quite long ones (around 2 to 4 times longer).

### Seasonality

It is evident that seasonalisy plays a big role in terms of riding beahviour and for this reason I want to dig deeper in the matter.
I'll therefore try to analyse data in quarters which roughly correspond to the four seasons.

### Q1 - Winter

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69009356/154130635-e84f7c32-6715-4d1c-be70-5866f911a80f.png" />
</p>

We can see that members are more active during the central days of the week, while casual riders are more active during the weekend, Sundays in particular.
In terms of time spent both groups are generally consistent throught the week.
On top of this, I also want to see what are the most popular routes among the groups.


<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69009356/153855563-9be991eb-aa04-4dad-86e7-6dc44ce135de.png" />
</p>

I have used a similar query for the members.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69009356/154131752-d5a4c064-9d97-4c6c-82c3-4dca7c0b54d4.png" />
</p>

We can see that the pattern here is quite different.
Most popular routes for members are in the inner part of the city (first two routes pass trough a university).
Most popular routes for casual riders are circular rides, that seem to hint to some kind of recreational ride as they are mostly close to the coast of lake Michigan.

### Q2 - Spring

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69009356/154133367-5236a314-b72b-4a81-b622-768d0fe19265.png" />
</p>

In spring we can see a certain peak around the weekend for both groups, which is also reflected by the time spent riding.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69009356/154133776-7f2e1409-fdc4-4403-8bcb-abd8de3321ce.png" />
</p>

Here the pattern seems similar for casual riders while we can see an important presence of recreational routes amonng the members, alongside other routes in the inner part of the city.

### Q3 - Summer

<p align="center">
  <img src="(https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69009356/154135031-153c8027-6ae8-4ff8-a930-9d4b655212d8.png" />
</p>

In the summer we can an incredible increase in terms of volume of rides in both groups.
Members are still consistent with spikes on wednesday and in the weekend, while casual riders peak from friday to sunday.
Again time spent is line with the with the above mentioned pattern.

<p align="center">

</p>


### Trips

## 6. Act
